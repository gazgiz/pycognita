Analyze this image to provide structured data for a Knowledge Graph using a 'Chain of Description' method.
Step 1: Identify the Overall Situation. What is happening globally? (e.g., 'A busy commute at a train station').
Step 2: Justify your identification. Why is it this situation? (e.g., 'Because I see a [Crowd] waiting near the [Ticket Gates]').
Step 3: Drill down into the entities mentioned. Describe them and their states.
   - 'The [Crowd] is dense and moving towards the platform.'
   - 'The [Ticket Gates] are open and metallic.'
Step 4: Continue drilling down until no meaningful details remain.
Step 5: Output strictly as a list of atomic statements (Subject - Predicate - Object format).
Format rules:
- Start with: 'This image depicts [Situation/Context].'
- [Subject] [predicate] [Object]
- CRITICAL: Do NOT repeat the same action for multiple individuals (e.g., NO 'Person 1 is entering', 'Person 2 is entering'). Group them: 'Crowd is entering'.
Example:
- This image depicts a Graduation Ceremony.
- Graduation Ceremony involves Graduates and Audience.
- Graduates are wearing Cap and Gown.
- Audience is sitting in Bleachers.
Do NOT write paragraphs. List separate facts.
